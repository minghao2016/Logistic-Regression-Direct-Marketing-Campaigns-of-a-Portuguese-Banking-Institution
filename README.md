# Logistic-Regression-Direct-Marketing-Campaigns-of-a-Portuguese-Banking-Institution

The goal of this analysis is to find a model using logistic regression techniques to help better predict the success of a contact, if the client subscribes the deposit or not. Logistic regression will be used to help understand how certain explanatory variables may influence the likelihood of an event occurring and can those explanatory variables be used to predict if an event will occur or not. Such model can increase campaign efficiency by identifying the main characteristics that affect if a contact subscribed or not. This will help management make better use of the available resources and selection of a high quality and affordable set of potential buying customers.
